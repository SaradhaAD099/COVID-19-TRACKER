This project presents an interactive COVID-19 Data Analytics Dashboard built using PySpark and Streamlit to analyze, process, and visualize COVID-19 patient information from a structured JSON dataset. The system efficiently handles data preprocessing, cleaning, and aggregation through PySpark, enabling smooth exploration of demographic patterns, vaccination status, state-wise case distribution, recovery and mortality trends, and risk segmentation. With dynamic charts, customizable filters, and a patient-level data explorer, the dashboard transforms raw data into meaningful insights that are easy to interpret. Designed for students, researchers, and data-science learners, this dashboard provides a comprehensive analytical environment to study COVID-19 trends and supports informed, data-driven understanding of the pandemic.
